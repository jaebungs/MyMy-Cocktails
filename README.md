### Introduction

I enjoy and appreciate good drinks. However, my girlfriend and I found that searching for an easy cocktail recipe takes time.
Often recipes are filled with useless information. I scroll down and once reach the ingredient section, I find that I don’t have all the ingredients and need to repeat them. I just didn’t like to repeat the process.

The goal
Create an app that can provide relatively easy recipes with simple search functions. Even if the user does not have all the ingredients, this app should be able to suggest other options.

### Development process

1. Brainstorm app features.
- Search Function(by name, by ingredients, auto-complete).
- Oauth and custom login.
- Bookmark function.
- Build a simple REST API.
- Chip ingredients indicator.

2. Choose tools.
- React and Redux. I feel comfortable using React and feel much faster to build something with it.
- Material UI. I have been using (S)CSS and used Bootstrap before. I wanted to try a new framework.
- Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end.

3. Browse other cocktail recipe apps. Add or remove features.
- To differentiate from other apps already on the web/store, I had to know their design and features.

4. Brainstorm design.
Clean and minimalistic design can allow users to focus on the contents.
Same layout for Library and My bar page.

5. Start coding!
Build basic structure (to test backend).
Build API and make sample data in mongodb.
Build front-end. Test if data retrieves are working fine.
Start styling and deploy.
Small touch-ups.
