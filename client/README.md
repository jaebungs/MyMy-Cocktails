### Learning outcome  

wow. mapStateToProps and connect can be replaced by redux with hooks such as useSelector and useDispatch. Code got simpler.  
First time using many different hooks.  
I am never going to use material ui again...  
Made me think and learn more about normalize state shape. Although I didn't needed for this proejct.  
Refreshing express and mongodb.  
Need to learn more about animation on state change or learn react-spring.  
For a property update of a deeply nested object to be rendered, the high-level reference needs to be changed.
Use spread operator, but hard to read so nested reducer comes. However many reducers make hard to track.  
Therefore, library like immer.js comes. It creates a new state object by mutating current 'immutable state', so changing new object also changes the original object.
Learned about JSON web token and session token. This app uses JWT.  
Need to learn more about security, XSS(Cross site Scripting) and CSRF(Cross site Request Forgery).
